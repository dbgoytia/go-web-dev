FuncMap

Another feature that we can add to templates is the ability to pass in functions directly into the template for rendering.

This could be:
* Usefull for performing some view operations on the mvc paragidm, for example:
    * sorting
    * checking permissions
    * comparison
    * formatting

* All of the previous operations, and many more, can be concatenated using *pipelineing*
