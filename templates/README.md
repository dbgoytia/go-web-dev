A Website tempalte is a predesigned resource that shows how the structure for a comprehensive layout and display features of any website will look. In the case of Go, in the standard library we have two main packages:

* text/templates
* html/templates

They are almost the same, except that html/templates has some extra built-in functionally for html websites.

Essentialy, they are made to give designers a relatively easy way to plug content into a sophisticated framework built through classic HTML and CSS. A website tempalte may include carefully laid out titles, square or round images, background banners, stirpes and other layout features. Designers take advantages of these templates and simply swap in their own data and images to get a very elaborate Web style withoug writing any code themselves.

Goal:

* Understand the use of templates in web development.
* Understand the standard library for web development in Go.
